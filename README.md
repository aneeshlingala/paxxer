## Dependencies
The dependencies are Git and Sudo. The script will install the other dependencies automatically.

## How to use

> Make sure to stay near the computer to answer prompts. Also, the username is aneesh

## Notes for PaxxerAL
PaxxerAL has been untested and will most likely not be tested in the future. If you are able to test and report, that would be great! Also, PaxxerAL has not been synced with the PaxxerDEB which means it still uses the old desktop environment and themes/icons.

## Run time
The script takes 15 minutes ➡ 1 hour, depending on your internet speed.

In very slow internet speeds, it may take even longer than the estimated time.

## For x64 Users

Install Debian/Arch Linux with XFCE Desktop and make sure your user has sudo permissions, or the script will break.

> Note: This script will delete the current user and its data and replace it with user "aneesh". Proceed with caution.

Paxxer is licensed Under GPLv3. Check the LICENSE file for a copy of the GPLv3 license.
