## Dependencies
The dependencies are Git and Sudo. The script will install the other dependencies automatically.

> Make sure to stay near the computer to answer prompts. Also, the username is aneesh

## Notes for PaxxerAL
PaxxerAL has been untested and will most likely not be tested in the future. If you, the reader, are able to test and report, that would be great! Also, PaxxerAL has not been synced with PaxxerDEB, which means it still uses the older desktop environment choice and the older themes/icons choice.

## Run time
The script takes 15 minutes ➡ 1 hour, depending on your internet speed.

In very slow internet speeds, it may take even longer than the estimated time.

## For x64 Users

Install Debian/Arch Linux with XFCE Desktop and make sure your user has sudo permissions, or the script will break.

> Note: This script will delete the current user and its data and replace it with user "aneesh". Proceed with caution.

## For PostmarketOS Users

Use an image with the 'console desktop' at https://images.postmarketos.org. The username is 'user' and the password is '147147'

## For Raspberry Pi Users

Use a Raspberry Pi OS Lite x64 image.

> PaxxerRpi has only been tested on a Raspberry Pi 4B. Please exercise caution when using this script on another Raspberry Pi.
